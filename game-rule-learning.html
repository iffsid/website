	<h1>Game-Rule Learning</h1>
	<br clear="all" />

	Three independent agents, the <i>protagonist</i>, <i>antagonist</i>,
	and the <i>wannabe</i> share an instantiation of our robotic testbed in
	this endeavour to learn board-game rules.  Two of these,
	the <i>protagonist</i> and the <i>antagonist</i>, are given the rules
	of the game, while the <i>wannabe</i> is not.  The <i>protagonist</i>
	and the <i>antagonist</i> then play a series of physically instantiated
	games of a particular kind, while the <i>wannabe</i> watches.<br/><br/>

	The <i>wannabe</i> then infers the rules of the game purely from
	visual-input.  It then takes the place of one of the earlier players,
	say the <i>antagonist</i>, and uses the learned rules to drive
	physically instantiated play.  Note that we aim to learn to
	play <i>legally</i>, not necessarily <i>well</i>.<br/><br/>

	An example of such a system, end-to-end, is shown here:<br/><br/>

	rules, learned rules, and robotic play from learned rules for
	Tic-Tac-Toe, Hexapawn, and four variants of Hexapawn.<br/><br/>
